# K-VECHICLE
The goal of the project was to create a vehicle that can autonomously navigate through a series of waypoints (GPS coordinates) while avoiding any obstacles it encounters along the way.
My robot is a mobile platform of any kind of exploration robot so that it can
navigates through designated waypoints while trying to avoid obstacles. And
finally comes back to the starting point or another place. To minimize the time
and money for building a new mobile platform, it is based on commonly used
scale RC model car with some modification.
